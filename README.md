# Credit-Card-Fraud Detection System
Detecting the frauds in Credit card transaction


Fraud transactions allow criminals to take advantage of legitimate usersâ€™ funds, inflicting them financial harm. Access to credit card transaction data, fraud strategies, recognising scams in bulk data that is produced extremely quickly, and imbalanced data are all major challenges in detecting fraudulent credit card transactions.

Thus, We need a fraud detection model which should perform accurate detection of fraudulent transactions and should not identify real transactions as fraud.

In this Credit card Fraud Detection project following steps are followed:
Data Exploration
Preprocessing
Data Preparation
Model Building
Model Evaluation

Performance of the model was done on these metrics:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall score
F1-Score

Result of the project: The performance of various models is listed below:
